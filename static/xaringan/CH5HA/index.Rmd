## Packages

Getting started

```
library(tidyverse)
library(fpp3)
library(purrr)
library(gganimate)
library(seasonal)
```


---
# A bit on homework

```{r}
PBS %>% features(Cost, list(mean = mean, sd = sd))  %>% arrange(desc(mean))
PBS %>% features(Cost, list(mean = mean, sd = sd))  %>% arrange(sd)
```

```{r}
tourism_features <- tourism %>%
  features(Trips, feature_set(pkgs = "feasts"))
library(glue)
tourism_features %>%
    select_at(vars(contains("season"), c(Purpose, State, Region))) %>%
    mutate(
        seasonal_peak_year = glue("Q{seasonal_peak_year+1}"),
        seasonal_trough_year = glue("Q{seasonal_trough_year+1}"),
    ) %>% filter(Purpose == "Holiday") %>% ggplot() + aes(x=seasonal_peak_year, facet=State) + geom_bar() + facet_wrap(vars(State))

## Features: Summary


The features command is the magic tool for tidy summary and statistics for time series in this index/key format.  For example, basic summary

```{r}
load("USEmployment.RData")
us_employment %>% data.frame() %>% group_by(Series_ID) %>% summarise(Title = first(Title)) %>% mutate(series_id = Series_ID) %>% ungroup() %>% select(-Series_ID) -> Names.List
US.Employment.T <- left_join(US.Employment, Names.List, by = c("series_id" = "series_id")) %>% mutate(YM = yearmonth(date)) %>% rename(Employed = value) %>% as_tsibble(., index=YM, key=Title)
USET <- US.Employment.T %>% filter(YM > yearmonth("1990-01"), Title%in%c("Retail Trade","Financial Activities","Manufacturing")) %>% as_tsibble(., index=YM, key=Title) 
USET %>% features(Employed, features=list(mean=mean,min=min,max=max,sd=sd,quantile))
```

---

### Features: Correlation Features

Learning about the time series properties

```{r}
USET %>% features(Employed, features=feat_acf)
```
```{r}
USET %>% group_by(Title) %>% ACF(Employed) %>% autoplot()
```

---
### For Contrast: Ford Returns

```{r}
library(tidyquant)
Ford <- tq_get("F", from="2000-01-01")
FordT <- Ford %>% as_tsibble(index=date)
FordT %>% autoplot(adjusted)
```

---

```{r}
FC <- Ford %>% tq_transmute(adjusted, mutate_fun = periodReturn, period = "monthly") %>% mutate(YM = yearmonth(date)) %>% as_tsibble(., index=YM)
FC %>% autoplot(monthly.returns)
```

---
## Ford's ACF

The 6/7 and 12/13 patterns are interesting....

```{r}
library(patchwork)
FC1 <- FC %>% ACF(monthly.returns) %>% autoplot()
FC2 <- FC %>% PACF(monthly.returns) %>% autoplot()
FC1+FC2
```

---

## Decomposition Features

```{r}
USET %>% features(Employed, feat_stl)
```

---

## With More Data

```{r}
NUSET8k <- US.Employment.T %>% data.frame() %>% group_by(Title) %>% summarise(MaxE = max(Employed)) %>% arrange(desc(MaxE)) %>% filter(MaxE > 8000 & MaxE < 120000) 
USET8k <- left_join(NUSET8k, US.Employment.T) %>% as_tsibble(., index=YM, key=Title)
```

---
# An Improvement on the Trend/Season

```{r, cache=FALSE, results='hide', echo=FALSE}
library(plotly); library(widgetframe)
USET8k %>%
    features(Employed, feat_stl) %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = trend_strength, y = seasonal_strength_year, text = Title)) +
    geom_point() -> jj
k <- ggplotly(jj)
htmltools::save_html(k, file="st.html")
```

---

The details are at the bottom [for other statistics](https://otexts.com/fpp3/stlfeatures.html).

```{r}
library(kableExtra)
USET8k %>%
    features(Employed, feat_stl) %>% knitr::kable(format="html") %>% scroll_box(width = "100%", height = "300px")
```


---
### `coef_hurst`

A measure of the degree to which adjacent observations depend on one another over time.  Generically, this statistic takes values between zero and one with one indicating very high levels of dependence through time.

```{r}
USET %>% features(Employed, coef_hurst)
```


---
## Middling for Ford

```{r}
FC %>% features(monthly.returns, features=coef_hurst)
```

---
# `feat_spectral`

```{r}
USET %>% features(Employed, feat_spectral)
FC %>% features(monthly.returns, features=feat_spectral)
```

---
# The Absence of Correlation

Ljung-Box modifies the idea in the Box-Pierce statistic for assessing whether or not a given series [or transformation thereof] is essentially uncorrelated.  In both cases, we will get to the details next week [chapter 5].  For now, the idea is simply that $k$ squared autocorrelations will sum to a chi-squared distribution with $k$ degrees of freedom.  Large correlations reveal dependence.

```{r}
USET %>% features(Employed, features=list(box_pierce, ljung_box))
FC %>% features(monthly.returns, features=list(box_pierce, ljung_box))
```


---
# `feat_pacf`

```{r}
USET %>% features(Employed, feat_pacf)
FC %>% features(monthly.returns, features=feat_pacf)
```

---
# Unit Roots

The stationarity issue from earlier is given much attention.  Can we reasonably think of characteristics as fixed?  There are three means of assessment with details to Chapter 9.

```{r}
USET %>% features(Employed, features=list(unitroot_kpss, unitroot_pp, unitroot_ndiffs, unitroot_nsdiffs)) %>% knitr::kable(format="html")
FC %>% features(monthly.returns, features=list(unitroot_kpss, unitroot_pp, unitroot_ndiffs, unitroot_nsdiffs))
```

---
# Tiling

[A reminder](https://davisvaughan.github.io/slider/)

```{r}
USET %>% features(Employed, features=list(var_tiled_mean, var_tiled_var))
FC %>% features(monthly.returns, features=list(var_tiled_mean, var_tiled_var))
```

---
# Detecting Shifts

```{r}
USET %>% features(Employed, features=list(shift_level_max, shift_var_max, shift_kl_max)) %>% kable(format="html")
FC %>% features(monthly.returns, features=list(shift_level_max, shift_var_max, shift_kl_max)) %>% kable(format="html")
```

---
# Crossings and Flat Spots

```{r}
USET %>% features(Employed, features=list(n_crossing_points, longest_flat_spot)) %>% kable(format="html")
FC %>% features(monthly.returns, features=list(n_crossing_points, longest_flat_spot)) %>% kable(format="html")
```

---

# ARCH

What proportion of the current squared residual is explained by the prior squared residual?  This reports $R^2$; if the variance explained is large, volatility is persistent.  **There is a chi-square statistic also.**

```{r}
USET %>% features(Employed, features=stat_arch_lm) %>% kable(format="html")
FC %>% features(monthly.returns, features=stat_arch_lm) %>% kable(format="html")
```

---

## The Box-Cox

```{r}
USET %>% features(Employed, features=guerrero) %>% kable(format="html")
FC %>% features(monthly.returns, features=guerrero) %>% kable(format="html")
```



```{r}
USET %>% features(Employed, features=guerrero)
```

---
# Filtered Manufacturing

```{r}
USET %>% filter(Title=="Manufacturing") %>% mutate(Filt = box_cox(Employed, 1.0369662)) %>% select(YM,Filt,Employed) %>% pivot_longer(c(Filt,Employed)) %>% autoplot(value)
```

---

```{r}
USET %>% filter(Title=="Financial Activities") %>% autoplot(box_cox(Employed, 0.9481456))
```

---

```{r}
USET %>% filter(Title=="Retail Trade") %>% autoplot(box_cox(Employed, 1.1860464))
```

---

```{r}
FC %>% features(monthly.returns, features=guerrero)
FC %>% autoplot(box_cox(monthly.returns, 0.6857523))
```

# Principal Components

Let's walk through this example.

# The Forecasting Workflow

![The pic](img/Workflow.png)

---
# An Example: Forecast Annual GDP

```{r}
gdppc <- global_economy %>%
  mutate(GDP_per_capita = GDP / Population)
fit <- gdppc %>%
  model(trend_model = TSLM(GDP_per_capita ~ trend()))
```

---
# A Result [report]

```{r}
fit %>% filter(Country=="Sweden") %>% report()
```

---
# The New Piece: Models

What models?

`fable`: [linked here](https://fable.tidyverts.org/reference/index.html)


---
# Basic Forecasts

1. Averages  
2. Naive methods
3. Seasonal naive methods
4. The drift method

---
# Key Features of a Model

- Fits  
- Residuals  

---
# Residual diagnostics are crucial

At a minimum, residuals should be `white noise` [or remaining exploitable information] and have zero mean [unbiased forecasts].

---
# `forecast` is amazing

Especially with `hilo`.

---
# Evaluation

Point accuracy: training and test
Distributional accuracy: measures
Cross-validation: step ahead
