# How do we learn from data?

### It is probably better posed as, what can we learn from data?

# The Big Idea

## **Inference**

In the most basic form, learning something about data that we do not have from data that we do.  In the jargon of statistics, we characterize the probability distribution of some feature of the population of interest from a sample drawn randomly from that population. 
  
--

### Quantities of Interest:  
**Single Proportion**  
*The probability of some qualitative outcome with appropriate uncertainty.&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;*   
**Single Mean**  
*The average of some quantitative outcome with appropriate uncertainty.&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;*    
  
.footnote[
&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; Which will itself be a probability measure.

### Quantities of Interest:  
**Compare Proportions**  
*Compare key probabilities across two groups with appropriate uncertainty.&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;*  
**Compare Means**  
*Compare averages/means across two groups with appropriate uncertainty.&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;*

# Inference for Data

Of two forms:

1. Binary/Qualitative

--

2. Quantitative

--

We will first focus on the former.

---
## Qualitative: The Binomial

Is entirely defined by two parameters, `\(n\)` -- the number of subjects -- and `\(\pi\)` -- the probability of a positive response.  The probability of exactly `\(x\)` positive responses is given by:

$$ Pr(X = x | \pi, n) = {n \choose x} \pi^x (1-\pi)^{n-x} $$

The binomial is the `canonical` distribution for binary outcomes.  *Assuming all `\(n\)` subjects are alike and the outcome occurs with `\(\pi\)` probability*,&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; then we must have a sample from a binomial.  *A binomial with `\(n=1\)` is known as a Bernoulli trial* 

Two key features:
1. Expectation: `\(n \cdot \pi\)` or number of subjects times probability, `\(\pi \textrm{ if } n=1\)`.
2. Variance is `\(n \cdot \pi \cdot (1 - \pi)\)`  or `\(\pi(1-\pi) \textrm{ if } n=1\)` and standard deviation is `\(\sqrt{n \cdot \pi \cdot (1 - \pi)}\)` or `\(\sqrt{\pi(1-\pi)} \textrm{ if } n=1\)`.

Now let's grab some data and frame a question.

.footnote[&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; **If this does not hold, we will seek the homogenous groups in which it does.**]

## Berkeley Admissions  
  
What is the probability of being admitted to UC Berkeley Graduate School?&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;  
  
--
  
I have three variables: Admitted or not, Gender, and Department applied to.  
&lt;span style="color: yellow;"&gt;Admission is the key.&lt;/span&gt;


```r
*library(janitor)
UCBTab &lt;- data.frame(UCBAdmissions) %&gt;% reshape::untable(., .$Freq) %&gt;% select(-Freq) 
UCBTab %&gt;% tabyl(Admit)  # Could also use UCBTab %$% table(Admit) 
```

```
##     Admit    n   percent
##  Admitted 1755 0.3877596
##  Rejected 2771 0.6122404
```

The proportion is denoted as `\(\hat{p}\)`.  We can also do this with *table*.

.footnote[&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; **We probably think this depends on a bunch of applicant specific features but we will put that to the side for now.**]

# The Idea

Suppose we want to know `\(\pi(Admit)\)` -- the probability of being admitted -- with 90% probability.  We want to take the data that we saw and use it to **infer** the likely values of `\(\pi(Admit)\)`.  

--

### Three interchangeable methods

1. Resampling/Simulation

--

2. Exact binomial computation

--

3. A normal approximation


---
## Method 1: Resampling

**Suppose I have 4526 chips with 1755 &lt;span style="color: green;"&gt;green&lt;/span&gt; and 2771 &lt;span style="color: red;"&gt;red&lt;/span&gt;.**  

--

I toss them all on the floor

--

and pick them up, one at a time, 

--

record the value (&lt;span style="color: green;"&gt;green&lt;/span&gt;/&lt;span style="color: red;"&gt;red&lt;/span&gt;), 
--

put the chip back,  
*[NB: I put it back to avoid getting exactly the same `sample` every time.]*

--

and repeat 4526 times.  

--

**Each count of &lt;span style="color: green;"&gt;green chips&lt;/span&gt; as a proportion of 4526 total chips constitutes an estimate of the probability of Admit.**

--

I wrote a little program to do just this -- `ResampleProps`.  
```
remotes::install_github("robertwwalker/ResampleProps")
```

# Resampling Result


```r
library(ResampleProps)
RSMP &lt;- ResampleProp(UCBTab$Admit, k = 10000, tab.col = 1) %&gt;% data.frame(Pi.Admit=., Gender=as.character("All"), frameN = 1) 
quantile(RSMP$Pi.Admit, probs = c(0.05,0.95))
```

```
##        5%       95% 
## 0.3760495 0.3994808
```

What is our estimate of `\(\pi\)` with 90% confidence?   

*The probability of admission ranges from 0.376 to 0.399.*

---
# A Plot


```r
library(ggthemes)
RSMP %&gt;%  ggplot(., aes(x=Pi.Admit)) + geom_density(outline.type = "upper", color="maroon") +labs(x=expression(pi)) + theme_minimal() + theme_xaringan()
```

&lt;img src="index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-6-1.jpeg" width="504" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;



---
## Another Way: Exact binomial

That last procedure is correct but it is overkill.

1. With probability of 0.05, how small could `\(\pi\)` be to have gotten 1755 of 4526 or more?  

2. With probability 0.95, how big could `\(\pi\)` be to have gotten  fewer than 1755 of 4526?


```r
*UCBTab %$% table(Admit)
```

```
## Admit
## Admitted Rejected 
##     1755     2771
```

--

**`binom.test` does exactly this.**

---
class: inverse
## binom.test()


```r
UCBTab %$% table(Admit) %&gt;% binom.test(conf.level = 0.9)
```

```
## 
## 	Exact binomial test
## 
## data:  .
## number of successes = 1755, number of trials = 4526, p-value &lt; 2.2e-16
## alternative hypothesis: true probability of success is not equal to 0.5
## 90 percent confidence interval:
##  0.3757924 0.3998340
## sample estimates:
## probability of success 
##              0.3877596
```

```r
Plot.Me &lt;- binom.test(1755, 1755+2771, conf.level=0.9)$conf.int %&gt;% data.frame()
```

**With 90% probability, now often referred to as 90% confidence to avoid using the word probability twice, the probability of being admitted ranges between 0.3758 and 0.3998.**

## A Third Way: The normal approximation

As long as `\(n\)` and `\(\pi\)` are sufficiently large, we can approximate this with a normal distribution.  **This will also prove handy for a related reason.**  

As long as `\(n*\pi\)` &gt; 10, we can write that a standard normal `\(z\)` describes the distribution of `\(\pi\)`, given `\(n\)` -- the sample size and `\(\hat{p}\)` -- the proportion of yes's/true's in the sample.

$$ Pr(\pi) = \hat{p} \pm z \cdot \left( \sqrt{\frac{\hat{p}*(1-\hat{p})}{n}} \right) $$

`\(R\)` implements this in `prop.test`.  By default, R implements a modified version that corrects for discreteness/continuity.  To get the above formula exactly, `prop.test(table, correct=FALSE)`.

---
class: inverse
### A first look at hypotheses

$$ z = \frac{\hat{p} - \pi}{\sqrt{\frac{\pi(1-\pi)}{n}}} $$

With some proportion calculated from data `\(\hat{p}\)` and some claim about `\(\pi\)` -- hereafter called an hypothesis -- we can use `\(z\)` to calculate/evaluate the claim.  

These claims are *hypothetical* values of `\(\pi\)`.  They can be evaluated against a specific alternative considered in three ways:  
- two-sided, that is `\(\pi = value\)` against not equal.  
- `\(\pi \geq value\)` against something smaller.  
- `\(\pi \leq value\)` against something greater.  

In the first case, either much bigger or much smaller values could be evidence against equal.  The second and third cases are always about smaller and bigger; they are one-sided.

Just as `\(z\)` has metric standard deviations now referred to as standard errors of the proportion, the z here will measure where the data fall with respect to the hypothetical `\(\pi\)`.  

*With z sufficiently large, and in the proper direction, our hypothetical `\(\pi\)` becomes unlikely given the evidence and should be dismissed.*

```
## [1] 7.846435e-52
```

Any `\(|z| &gt; 1.64\)` -- probability 0.05 above and below -- is sufficient to dispense with the hypothesis.

]

.pull-right[

## One-Sided

`\(\pi \leq 0.5\)` against `\(\pi \gt 0.5\)`.

With 90% confidence, `\(z &gt; 1.28\)` is sufficient.

`\(\pi \geq 0.5\)` against `\(\pi \lt 0.5\)`.

With 90% confidence, `\(z &lt; -1.28\)` is sufficient.

# The normal approximation


```r
prop.test(table(UCBTab$Admit), conf.level = 0.9, correct=FALSE)
```

```
## 
## 	1-sample proportions test without continuity correction
## 
## data:  table(UCBTab$Admit), null probability 0.5
## X-squared = 228.07, df = 1, p-value &lt; 2.2e-16
## alternative hypothesis: true p is not equal to 0.5
## 90 percent confidence interval:
##  0.3759173 0.3997361
## sample estimates:
##         p 
## 0.3877596
```

`\(R\)` reports the result as `\(z^2\)` not `\(z\)` which is `\(\chi^2\)` not normal; we can obtain the `\(z\)` by taking a square root: $$\sqrt{228.08} \approx 15.1 $$

This approximation yields an estimate of `\(\pi\)`, with 90% confidence, that ranges between 0.376 and 0.4.

# A Cool Consequence of Normal

The formal equation defines:

$$ z = \frac{\hat{p} - \pi}{\sqrt{\frac{\pi(1-\pi)}{n}}} $$
--

Some language:
1. Margin of error is `\(\hat{p} - \pi\)`.  [MOE]
2. Confidence: the probability coverage given z [two-sided].
3. We need a guess at the true `\(\pi\)` because variance/std. dev. depend on `\(\pi\)`.  0.5 is common because it maximizes the variance; we will have enough no matter what the true value.

--

Algebra allows us to solve for `\(n\)`.

$$ n = \frac{z^2 \cdot \pi(1-\pi)}{(\hat{p} - \pi)^2} $$

### Example

Estimate the probability of supporting an initiative to within 0.03 with 95% confidence.  Assume that the probability is 0.5 [it maximizes the variance and renders a conservative estimate -- an upper bound on the sample size]

# One More Oddity

What is our estimate of `\(\pi\)` with 90% confidence?  

**The probability of admission ranges from 0.3760495 to 0.3994808.**

If we wish to express this using the normal approximation, a central interval is the observed proportion plus/minus `\(z\)` times the *standard error of the proportion* -- $$ SE(\hat{p}) = \sqrt{\frac{\hat{p}(1-\hat{p})}{n}} $$  NB: The sample value replaces our assumed true value because `\(\pi\)` is to be solved for.  For 90%, the probability of admissions ranges from


```r

### The Standard Error of the Difference

Following something akin to the FOIL method, we can show that the variance of a difference in two random variables is the sum of the variances minus twice the covariance between them.

$$Var(X - Y) = Var(X) + Var(Y) - 2*Cov(X,Y) $$

If we assume [or recognize it is generally unknownable] that the male and female samples are independent, the covariance is zero, and the variance of the difference is simply the sum of the variance for male and female, respectively, and **zero covariance**.

`$$SE(\hat{p}_{M} - \hat{p}_{F}) =  \sqrt{ \underbrace{\frac{\hat{p}_{M}(1-\hat{p}_{M})}{n_{M}}}_{Males} + \underbrace{\frac{\hat{p}_{F}(1-\hat{p}_{F})}{n_{F}}}_{Females}}$$`

## Inference for Quantitative Data

**What is the average level of expenditure by Ethnicity?**

Why do we focus on the average?  Under general conditions, the average has a known probability distribution even if the distribution of the underlying data is unknown.  This is a result of the central limit theorem and a generic property of averaging.

--

put the chip back,  
*[NB: I put it back to avoid getting exactly the same sample every time.]*  

--

and repeat this to create a sample of n=777.  
--

Use random sampling to sample the mean/average 10000 times.

## A Parametric Alternative

Under general conditions, the sample and population mean can be described by the `\(t_{df}\)` distribution with a single parameter -- degrees of freedom [df] -- and metric standard errors of the mean: `\(\frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}\)` as follows:

$$ t_{df} = \frac{\overline{x} - \mu}{\frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}} $$  

Given any observed sample of data, only two features of the aforementioned equation remain unknown: `\(\mu\)` -- the true mean -- and `\(t_{df}\)`.  Solving for `\(\mu\)` yields:

$$ \mu = \overline{x} - t_{df} \cdot \left( \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}} \right) $$

1. The resampling approach  
2. t-tests

## Comparing Means by Resampling

The method is similar to the approach for comparing proportions.  We will:  
1. Take a random sample of the same size as the original for each group *with replacement*.  
2. Calculate the average for each group and the difference in the averages.  
3. Repeat steps 1 and 2 `\(k\)` times for `\(k\)` samples.
