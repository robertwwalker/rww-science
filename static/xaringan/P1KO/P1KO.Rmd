# Some Comments on Workflow

Everything is built around R and RStudio.

--

RMarkdown is my tool of choice.  

--

In fact, these slides are RMarkdown rendered as .html.  

--

The *RStudio* has a *knit* button that renders the document so long as it contains the appropriate packages.

--

It is literate programming; it allows us to combine results and output.  

--

In a host of different formats.  

--

That are fundamentally reproducible: *the key to science*.

# Some Example Data

The data are Bond.Funds.  We have an ID, Type, Assets, Fees [Yes or No], Expense Ratio, Returns in 2009, 3 year, 5 year, and a Risk classification.  A [link to the data](https://github.com/robertwwalker/DADMStuff/raw/master/BondFunds.csv).

```{r, eval=FALSE, tidy=TRUE}
load(url("https://github.com/robertwwalker/DADMStuff/raw/master/R-Workspace-Lecture-1.RData"))
Bonds %>% datatable(class = "compact", rownames = FALSE, extensions = "Buttons",
                options = list(dom = 'tBp', scrollY = TRUE, buttons = c("csv","excel"), pageLength = 8)) %>%
  DT::formatRound(1:4, digits = 1)
# read from Excel:
# Bonds <- readxl::read_xls("/home/rob/Downloads/BondFundsSupport.xls", sheet="JustData")
```

---

```{r, echo=FALSE}
load(url("https://github.com/robertwwalker/DADMStuff/raw/master/R-Workspace-Lecture-1.RData"))
Bonds %>% datatable(class = "compact", 
                    rownames = FALSE, 
                    extensions = "Buttons",
                    options = list(dom = 'tBp', scrollY = TRUE, buttons = c("csv","excel"), pageLength = 8)) %>%
  DT::formatRound(1:4, digits = 1)

# My Current Thinking

An analogy: $R$ is like learning a foreign language.  It has the essential elements of   

- syntax 
- structure  
- scoping  

Learning how R thinks and communicates is crucial and that is largely an interaction between you and $R$.

** $R$ is a language for data. **

# Some Essential Excel

- Formulae  
- Absolute and relative references  
- Pivot tables   

It has some nice features.  

It fails the simple test of manipulability of the underlying data.

---


## Formulae

Pre-programmed functions that take input ranges of cells and produce particular outputs.

A [link to some data](https://github.com/robertwwalker/DADMStuff/raw/master/BondFunds.csv).

e.g. set cell `J5` to be:

```
=AVERAGE(C2:C21)
```

This averages the range between C2 and C21 [Assets].  When we copy this left or right, up or down, the numbers and/or letters adjust.  

**Let's try to make column L into `=C2 - J5` all the way down to C21.**  

NB: The average is technically known as the *arithmetic mean*; it is sometimes short-formed to the mean, though there are geometric and harmonic variants, also.

---

## Cell Referencing

We may not want that.  Suppose that I want to create a column showing the difference of calories and average calories.  The `$` holds an index constant [F4].  We have two.  In our case, we can hold both the rows and the column constant for the average.  Because we are only copying down, the `$5` would have sufficed.

```
=C2 - $J$5
=C2 - J$5
```

Then copy the formula down to L21.  Notice the C changes [no $] but the J doesn't. **The $ enables absolute cell referencing.** 

---

As expected.  Average assets over the first 20 is 1894.7; the first is 5373.4 above the average for this set.

## Formulae and Recursion

This can become quite involved; spreadsheets are programming tools.  **Their underlying problem is that they do not enforce rules or discipline along the way.**

The key to our formulae are one or more inputs, a series of transformation and operations, and one or more outputs defined in a precise fashion.  As an aside, the father of recursion as a core principle in computer science is teaching at Willamette this term -- Eric S. Roberts.  Functions link inputs and outputs. 

**They are models.**

# Pivot Tables

Are really cool; they are a very simple and quick way to slice and data and to gain useful comparative and/or summary insight.

They have the added virtue of being drag and drop.

All of the action comes in the calculations shown in the pivot table.  Unfortunately, it is extraordinarily limited.  What if I want the first and third quartiles?

---

# R-escue

This will become easy with the group_by command in R's tidyverse.

```{r}
Bonds %>% group_by(Type) %>% summarise(Avg.Assets = mean(Assets, na.rm=TRUE),
                                       Avg.Returns = mean(`Return 2009`, na.rm=TRUE),
                                       `Assets 25th` = quantile(Assets, probs = c(0.25), na.rm = TRUE),
                                       `Assets 75th` = quantile(Assets, probs = c(0.75), na.rm = TRUE)) %>% kableExtra::kable()
```

---
## And it scales

```{r}
Bonds %>% group_by(Type,Risk) %>% summarise(Avg.Assets = mean(Assets, na.rm=TRUE),
                                       Avg.Returns = mean(`Return 2009`, na.rm=TRUE),
                                       `Assets 25th` = quantile(Assets, probs = c(0.25), na.rm = TRUE),
                                       `Assets 75th` = quantile(Assets, probs = c(0.75), na.rm = TRUE)) %>% kableExtra::kable()
```

---
## `skim()`

.scroll-output[
```{r, echo=FALSE}
# install.packages("skimr")
library(skimr)
Bonds %>% group_by(Type,Risk) %>% skim(Assets)
```
]

---

## First Graphs

```{r Fig1, eval=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, display_type="both", include=FALSE, results='hide'}
Bonds %>% ggplot(., aes(x=`Return 2009`, fill=Type)) + 
  geom_density(alpha = 0.3) + 
  scale_xaringan_fill_discrete() + 
  theme_xaringan() + 
  facet_wrap(vars(Risk)) + 
  labs(title="2009 Returns by Risk and Type", x="Returns in 2009")
```

`r chunk_reveal("Fig1", split=30)`

---
# We Can Graph Exactly That

```{r Box1, eval=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, display_type="both", include=FALSE, results='hide'}
Bonds %>% ggplot(., aes(y=`Return 2009`, x=Type, color=Type)) + 
  geom_boxplot(alpha = 0.3) + 
  guides(color=FALSE) + 
  scale_color_viridis_d() + 
  theme_xaringan() + 
  facet_wrap(vars(Risk)) + 
  labs(title="2009 Returns by Risk and Type", y="Returns in 2009") +   
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, size=12))
```
`r chunk_reveal("Box1", split=30)`

---

```{r RTC, eval=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, display_type="both", include=FALSE, results='hide'}
Bonds %>% 
  group_by(Type,Risk) %>% 
  summarise(Count = n()) %>% 
  ggplot(., aes(x=Type, y=Risk, fill=Count)) + 
  geom_tile() + 
  labs(title="Funds by Risk and Type", y="Risk", x="Type")+ 
  scale_xaringan_fill_continuous() +
  theme_xaringan() + 
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, size=12))
```

`r chunk_reveal("RTC", split=30)`

# R Makes Data Understanding Easier

## Installing packages

R works by packages that add functionality.  The process is two parts: install a package [install.packages("package")] and then use it [library(package)].

R can handle installation for you.  In general, unless you know what it means, avoid compiling from source; binary packages are preferred.

```{r eval=FALSE, tidy=FALSE}
install.packages(c("tidyverse","skimr","magrittr","swirl","hrbrthemes","ggthemes"))
```

For your lab assignment, you will need

```{r eval=FALSE, tidy=FALSE}
install.packages(c("swirl"))
```

The [RStudio IDE](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/), is highly recommended but you do not have to.  The command line or the base GUI work but you will have to type to render RMarkdown and I use it alot.

---
# Interacting with R is Crucial

**That's where swirl and learnr come in.**

```{r eval=FALSE, tidy=FALSE}
swirl()
```

This is set up to email completions.  Or you can screenshot them.  It helps you learn how $R$ thinks.

# Takeaways

1. The biggest barrier to learning from data is not having a useful pipeline.  
--

2. Data should be tidy and easy to analyse.  We spend time analysing rather than cleaning.  
--

3. R makes getting data in and out easy.  It links with tons of things.  
--

4. R with Markdown make automated report writing and other literate uses of data, graphics, and text easy to do.  
--

5. The assignment for this week involves practicing this.  
--

6. There is a worked example in `Resources > R Documents > HOWTOExcel` to work with.
