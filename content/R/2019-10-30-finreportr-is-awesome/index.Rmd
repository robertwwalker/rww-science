## The Package: `finreport`

The key tool to facilitate the financial analysis of companies that file regular SEC reports of certain forms is `finreportr`. To make use of it, we must first have R install it and dependencies. To install it, `install.packages("finreportr", dependencies=TRUE)`.

## The Commands

The first command is `CompanyInfo()`.

```{r LCI}
library(finreportr)
CompanyInfo("JPM")

```

`CompanyInfo()` gives the basics on the company from the SEC including addresses, incorporation details, and numeric codes.

The next command is `AnnualReports()`. It returns a list of the reports with the type and the accession number of the actual document.

## JP Morgan [JPM]

```{r}
AnnualReports("JPM")
```

The analysis works on three financial reports: (1) `GetIncome()`, (2) `GetCashFlow()`, and (3) `GetBalanceSheet()`. Each takes as argument the ticker and the year. First, a look at the disclaimer.

### Income Statements

```{r}
JPM.IS <- GetIncome("JPM", 2015)
```

### Balance Sheets

```{r}
JPM.BS <- GetBalanceSheet("JPM", 2015)
```

### Statement of Cash Flows

```{r}
JPM.SCF <- GetCashFlow("JPM", 2015)
```

## Rendering a Useful Tool for Excel

I want to develop a tool to export the data that we have grabbed. How might we do that? This will involve a reshape that will require the reshape2 package. This can be done relatively systematically. The *reshape* command will take the `Metric` and `Units` as rows and place the `Amount` in columns defined by the `endDate`. The command is `dcast` and it takes an input file and restructures data according to a fixed rule. Here, I will have a `Metric` and `Units` for each of multiple entries defined by `endDate` with distinct `Amount` for each `endDate`. First, I will generate a separate version of each statement.

### Reshape: Rendering the Data in Wide Format

```{r}
library(reshape2)
JPM.IS.W <- dcast(JPM.IS, Metric + Units ~ endDate, value.var="Amount")
JPM.SCF.W <- dcast(JPM.SCF, Metric + Units ~ endDate, value.var="Amount")
JPM.BS.W <- dcast(JPM.BS, Metric + Units ~ endDate, value.var="Amount")
```

## Writing a file to Excel

Now I want to write the file to Excel and combine them. I will use `xlsx`.

```{r}
library(openxlsx) #load the package
write.xlsx(list(JPM.IS.W,JPM.BS.W,JPM.SCF.W), file = "JPM-2015.xlsx")
```

## The Coup de Grace for Excel Users

The last set of code can automate this. I will create a little function to do it all, taking as input, the ticker and year.

```{r}
getSEC <- function(ticker, year) {
options(scipen=12)
library(finreportr)
library(reshape2)
library(openxlsx)
SEC.IS <- GetIncome(ticker, 2015)
SEC.IS$Amount <- as.numeric(SEC.IS$Amount)
SEC.BS <- GetBalanceSheet(ticker, 2015)
SEC.BS$Amount <- as.numeric(SEC.BS$Amount)
SEC.SCF <- GetCashFlow(ticker, 2015)
SEC.SCF$Amount <- as.numeric(SEC.SCF$Amount)
SEC.IS.W <- dcast(SEC.IS, Metric + Units ~ endDate, value.var="Amount", fun.aggregate=mean)
SEC.SCF.W <- dcast(SEC.SCF, Metric + Units ~ endDate, value.var="Amount", fun.aggregate=mean)
SEC.BS.W <- dcast(SEC.BS, Metric + Units ~ endDate, value.var="Amount", fun.aggregate=mean)
write.xlsx(list(SEC.IS.W,SEC.BS.W,SEC.SCF.W), file = paste(ticker,"-",year,".xlsx", sep=""))
return(list(BS=SEC.BS,IS=SEC.IS,SCF=SEC.SCF))
}
```

Does it work?

```{r}
# Try the function on Target
TGT <- getSEC("TGT", 2015)
# Try the function on Mondelez
MDLZ <- getSEC("MDLZ", 2015)
```

It does not always work. Some statements are incomplete and the file fail.  Then we have to go back and figure it out.
