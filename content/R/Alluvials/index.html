<h2>Alluvial and Sankey Diagrams</h2>
<p>The aforementioned plots are methods for visualising the flow of data through a stream of markers. I was motivated to show this because enough of you deal in orders, tickets, and the like the flow visualisation of a system might prove of use. I will work with a familiar dataset. These are data on Admissions at the University of California Berkeley. The data exist as an internal R file in tabular form.</p>

<p>This is the tidy version that we worked with at the individual level. To make this code work, change the below locations to import the same data.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>load(url(&quot;https://github.com/robertwwalker/academic-mymod/raw/master/data/UCBtidy.RData&quot;))

<p>To put this data in a table, using the <code>%&gt;%</code> pipe operator, we will pass the tidy data, group it by the elements of the alluvial, and then generate the counts.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>DUCBT &lt;- DiscriminationUCB %&gt;% group_by(M.F,Dept,Admit) %&gt;% summarise(count = n()) %&gt;% ungroup()

<h2><code>ggalluvial()</code></h2>
<p>The alluvial requires an additional package <code>ggalluvial</code>. We can install it through</p>
<pre><code>install.packages(&quot;ggalluvial&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>What can it do? It needs data. The y axis is always the total counts in the cells. Then we set axes with a number after to show the phases from left to right. So here, axis1 will be gender and axis two will be Department. Admitted and non-admitted students <code>flowed</code> with colors depicting them move through the system. We want to track them by their admitted status. The alluvial itself has y as Frequency and the various axis* as the phases to track. The outcome of interest enters the fill so that color shows the outcome of interest flowing through the strata.</p>

<p>A lot of the code is just prettying. The most basic plot needs this:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>ggplot(UCBADF,  # plot the data
       aes(y = Freq, axis1 = Gender, axis2 = Dept)) + # what are the named axes
  geom_alluvium(aes(fill = Admit), width = 1/12) + # what variable will fill the paths; Admission here.
  geom_stratum(width = 1/12, fill = &quot;black&quot;, color = &quot;grey&quot;) + # This set the strata that our people will move through The one 12 is 12 combinations; the two colors here dfine the background and text for the labels.
