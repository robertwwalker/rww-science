```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(tidyverse)
library(tidyquant)
library(fpp3)
```

## A bit on equities

Some equities data is available from tidyquant.

```{r}
Ford <- tq_get("F", from="2019-01-01")
FordT <- Ford %>% as_tsibble(index=date)
FPT <- FordT %>% autoplot(adjusted)
```

## A Transformation

I want to show this as both the time series and as the returns -- the far more common method for analysing them.

```{r}
FC <- Ford %>% tq_transmute(adjusted, mutate_fun = periodReturn, period = "daily")
FCT <- FC %>% as_tsibble(., index=date) %>% autoplot(daily.returns)
```

What do they look like together?

```{r}
library(patchwork)
FPT + FCT
```
