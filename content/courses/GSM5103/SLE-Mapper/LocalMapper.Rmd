I found a starting point on [local maps in Seattle](https://www.littlemissdata.com/blog/maps).

```{r cars}
library(ggmap)
library(osmdata)
library(tidyverse)
```

## A Portland Map

The setup for a Google Cloud account is kind of a pain and it requires a billing option.  That was annoying but eventually fixed.

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
PDX <- get_map(getbb("Portland, OR"))
PDX %>% ggmap()
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
