# The Economist's Errors and Credit Where Credit is Due

*The Economist* is serious about their use of data visualization and they have occasionally owned up to errors in their visualizations.  They can be deceptive, uninformative, confusing, excessively busy, and present a host of other barriers to clean communication.  Their [blog post on their errors is great.](https://medium.economist.com/mistakes-weve-drawn-a-few-8cdd8a42d368)

I have drawn the following example from a `#tidyTuesday` earlier this year that explores this.  Here is the [link to the setup page](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2019/2019-04-16).

## Your Task

Your task comes in two parts.  The first one is to recreate any of the second through sixth visualizations: Brexit, Dogs, EU Balance, Pensions, or Trade.  You should have a look at the original and note the pathologies, but reproduce a nice visual (either their reconceptualization or something useful).  One thing to note is that three axis graphics are almost always bad.  

## A Template

For example, the first one; the example is bad because it cuts the axis.

# My Re-creation [in Labour red]

I built the whole thing in `equisse` with two exceptions.  First, reorder here is used to arrange the names in the order that I want to plot them.  By default they are alphabetical.  Second, I wanted the label geometry which is not an option in *esquisse* but one treats it like a point with the text as the plotting character.  In the aesthetic, it is a label;  `geom_text` does the same thing without a box but it harder to distinguish in this case.  If you want to play, the [cheat sheet is here](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/ggplot2-cheatsheet-2.1.pdf).

```{r Corbyn, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse) # call the tidyverse for %>% and ggplot
library(ggthemes) # Use the economist theme
corbyn <- readr::read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2019/2019-04-16/corbyn.csv")
# reorder will allow me to sort the names by the values.
# Uncomment to see: # with(corbyn, reorder(political_group,avg_facebook_likes))
# geom_label will allow me to put the numbers on the graph by specifying a label.
ggplot(corbyn, aes(x=reorder(political_group,avg_facebook_likes), y=avg_facebook_likes, label=avg_facebook_likes)) + 
  geom_bar(stat="identity", fill="#DC241f") + 
  geom_label(color="#DC241f") +
  labs(x="Associate of the Labour Party", y="Average Facebook Likes") +
  theme_economist() +
  coord_flip()
```

## Your Turn

In the next code chunk, you will need to cut and paste the code for grabbing your particular choice of data.

Now I am going to grab the *Brexit* data.

```{r StudentChoiceD}
brexit <- readr::read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2019/2019-04-16/brexit.csv")
summary(brexit)
# The variable names are too long and terrible.  Let me change them.
names(brexit) <- c("Date","Right","Wrong")
# The dates are also not read as proper dates.  Let me fix that.  It can also be fixed by coercion in esquisse
brexit$Date <- as.Date(brexit$Date, "%d/%m/%y")
brexit
```

The data are structured side by side and that makes it hard for R [or anything] to draw axes because it needs to know the boundaries for the axes.  I need to stack the rights and wrongs into one column with an associated label in another column for Right and Wrong.  That is *reshaping* data; pivoting longer and wider in the language of *tidyr*.

```{r}
# My first step is to stack the percent reporting on top of each other to make color and fill work properly.  I am going to take wider data [two columns of data] and stack them on top of each other.  What am I going to name this new stacked column?  "direction" and which columns do I wish to stack?  c(Right,Wrong)
My.Brexit <- brexit %>% pivot_longer(.,names_to = "direction",cols = c(Right,Wrong))
My.Brexit
brexit %>% ggplot(aes(x=Date, y=Right)) + geom_smooth(color="green", size=1) + geom_point(color = "green") + geom_point(aes(x=Date, y=Wrong), color="red") + geom_smooth(aes(x=Date, y=Wrong), color="red") + labs(y="% Saying Right [Green] or Wrong [Red] to UK Leaving EU")
```

## Your Graphic

```{r}
# The only addition beyond esquisse here is the addition of geom_smooth that gives me the smmoth intervals and annotate to write the sides in the graph instead of the legend..
ggp <- My.Brexit %>% ggplot(aes(x = Date, y = value, color=direction, fill = direction)) +
  geom_smooth(size = 1L) + 
  geom_point(size=1.5)  +
  scale_color_viridis_d(name="Direction", guide = FALSE) +
  scale_fill_viridis_d(name="Direction", guide = FALSE) +
  theme_economist_white() + labs(title="Bremorse...", subtitle = "In hindsight, do you think Britain was Right or Wrong to vote to leave the EU?", x="Date", y = "Percent Responding ...") + # add two annotations to the plot instead of a scale
  annotate("text" , x=as.Date("2018-01-01"), y=47, label="Wrong", size=6, color = "#fde725ff") + 
  annotate("text" , x=as.Date("2018-01-01"), y=41, label="Right", size=6, color = "#440154ff")
ggp
```

That's pretty cool.

## Pensions

```{r}
library(ggrepel) # I need to repel the labels.
pensions <- readr::read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2019/2019-04-16/pensions.csv")
pensions$scaled.65 <- scale(pensions$pop_65_percent)
pensions$scaled.GSgdp <- scale(pensions$gov_spend_percent_gdp)
pensions$prod.scaled <- pensions$scaled.65*pensions$scaled.GSgdp
```

Now a picture.  I want it simple but complete.  At first, I used text but it is not easy to read.

```{r}
pensions <- pensions %>% 
  mutate(Mean65 = mean(pop_65_percent), MeanSpend = mean(gov_spend_percent_gdp)) 
pensions %>% 
  ggplot(., aes(x=pop_65_percent, y=gov_spend_percent_gdp, label=country, color=prod.scaled))  + 
  geom_point(alpha=0.1) + 
  geom_hline(yintercept = mean(pensions$MeanSpend)) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = mean(pensions$Mean65)) + 
  geom_text(size=3, fill="white") + 
  labs(x="Percent of Population over 65", y="Government Pension Spending/GDP") + 
  theme_economist_white() + 
  labs(title="Population over 65 and Pension Spending per GDP", caption = "Coloring by Scaled Covariance") +  
  scale_color_viridis_c(guide=FALSE)
```


**ggrepel* allows labels that arrow to plot locations and keeps the labels from overlapping.  I called the library earlier, now I will use it's geom called *geom_label_repel*.

```{r}
ggplot(pensions) + 
  aes(x=pop_65_percent, y=gov_spend_percent_gdp, label=country, color=prod.scaled)  +
  geom_label_repel(size=3, fill="white") + 
  labs(x="Percent of Population over 65", y="Government Pension Spending/GDP") + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_hline(yintercept = mean(pensions$MeanSpend)) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = mean(pensions$Mean65)) + 
  theme_economist_white() + 
  labs(title="Population over 65 and Pension Spending per GDP", caption = "Coloring by Scaled Covariance") + 
  scale_color_viridis_c(guide=FALSE)
```

That seems to get it.  What's up with Brazil?

## dogs

```{r}
dogs <- readr::read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2019/2019-04-16/dogs.csv")
```

## esquisse

```{r}
p <- ggplot(dogs) + aes(x=avg_neck, y=avg_weight, size=year) + geom_point() + theme_economist_white() + labs(x="Neck Size", y="Weight", title="The Incredible Shrinking Dog?")
p
```

This is a perfect case for a text label.  If they are decent sized, they overlap.  I used `geom_text` which requires a label [label = year] in the aesthetic mapping.

```{r}
p <- ggplot(dogs) + aes(x=avg_neck, y=avg_weight, label=year) + geom_text(size=3, color="white") + theme_dark() + labs(x="Neck Size", y="Weight", title="The Incredible Shrinking Dog?") 
p
```

```{r}
library(emojifont)
p <- ggplot(dogs) + aes(x=avg_neck, y=avg_weight, size=-year, label = emoji('dog')) + geom_text() + theme_minimal() + labs(x="Neck Size", y="Weight", title="The Incredible Shrinking Dog?", caption = "Sized by Year -- decreasing...  Shrinking Dogs?") + guides(size=FALSE)
p
```


# EU Balances

```{r}
eu_balance <- readr::read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2019/2019-04-16/eu_balance.csv")
skimr::skim(eu_balance)
table(eu_balance$account_type)
table(eu_balance$country)
```



```{r}
ggplot(eu_balance) +
 aes(x = year, y = value, fill = account_type, color=account_type) +
 geom_line(size = 1L, alpha=0.3) + geom_hline(yintercept = 0, size=1, color="black") +
 scale_fill_hue() +
 theme_minimal() +
 facet_wrap(vars(country), scales = "free_y")
```

## trade

*gridExtra* allows us to combine multiple plots into one.  I build two plots and grid them together in the last line.

```{r}
library(gridExtra)
trade <- readr::read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2019/2019-04-16/trade.csv")
trade
p1 <- ggplot(trade, aes(x=year, y=trade_deficit/1000000000)) + geom_area(fill="red") + theme_economist() + labs(y = "US Trade Deficit in Billions of US $")
p2 <- ggplot(trade, aes(x=year, y=manufacture_employment/1000000)) + geom_line() + theme_economist() + labs(y = "US Manufacturing Employment in millions")
grid.arrange(p1,p2)
```

That is fairly simple and it works.  The trick here was to use a grid to create two plots and stack them.

# The Last One: No Solution Provided

The authors of the post give you good advice on how to solve this.  I contend that there is a great plot to generate using `esquisse` though it may not be just one plot.  Have a go.  If you wish to, you can peruse the appropriate timelines for `#tidyTuesday` and see what people came up with though in many cases, this will be apparent so use appropriate citations; it is easy to do with the examples here in this Markdown.

```{r}
women_research <- readr::read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2019/2019-04-16/women_research.csv")
women_research
# There's a spelling error I want to fix, select the rows and columns to fix and reassign the value
women_research[women_research$field=="Women inventores","field"] <- "Women Inventors" 
# The label for CS/Maths is too long, also
women_research[women_research$field=="Computer science, maths","field"] <- "CS/Math" 
```

The data consist of three columns and are a long pivot table.  The pivots are country and field with a quantitative indicator of the percent of women in the field.  It is a long pivot table characterised by country and field combinations in the rows.  To show the data cleanly, let me spread out the fields by widening the pivot table by fields.  

```{r}
# I find it far more intuitive to use pivot_wider but this will always work and is safer on versions of tidyr
# women_research %>% pivot_wider(field, percent_women) 
women_research %>% spread(field, percent_women) %>% knitr::kable()
```

# Visualize it...

The first way is to use *esquisse* and a simple grid plot for two categorical axes and add details to it in the boxes.

```{r}
ggp1 <- ggplot(women_research) +
 aes(x = field, y = country, fill = percent_women) +
 geom_tile(size = 1L) +
 scale_fill_viridis_c(option = "viridis") +
 labs(x = "Field or Occupation", y = "Country", title = "Publication and Invention by Women Around the World", subtitle = "Percent of Publications or Patents by Women", caption = "source: Economist Visualization Errors", fill = "Percent Women") +
 theme_minimal(base_size = 10)
ggp1 + theme(plot.background = element_rect(colour = "whitesmoke"))
```

We can also use equisse to build a faceted barplot by dragging the field to facet.  X is country, y is percent women, fill is country with facets determined by fields.

```{r}
women_research %>% ggplot(.) +
 aes(x = country, fill = country, weight = percent_women) +
 geom_bar() +
 scale_fill_hue() +
 coord_flip() +
 theme_minimal(base_size = 10) +
 theme(legend.position = "none") +
  labs(y = "Percent of Publications/Patents", x = "Country", title = "Publication and Invention by Women Around the World", subtitle = "Percent of Publications or Patents by Women", caption = "source: Economist Visualization Errors") +
 facet_wrap(vars(field))
```

Or reverse the above use of field and country where field is the X and the fill, y is still percent_women and facets are now countries.  This works quite well if only because there are 12 entities which grid into a 3 x 4 nicely.

```{r}
women_research %>% ggplot(.) +
 aes(x = field, fill = field, weight = percent_women) +
 geom_bar() +
 scale_fill_hue() +
 coord_flip() +
 theme_minimal(base_size = 10) +
 theme(legend.position = "none") +
  labs(y = "Percent of Publications/Patents", x = "Field", title = "Publication and Invention by Women Around the World", subtitle = "Percent of Publications or Patents by Women", caption = "source: Economist Visualization Errors") +
 facet_wrap(~country)
```


To show something very cool that R can do, I have added one more bit that is turned off.  In the following code chunk, I use `eval=FALSE` to avoid evaluating the chunk in R.  If the FALSE is changed to TRUE, R will need `ggiraph` via `install.packages("ggiraph")`.


```{r Girafe}
library(ggiraph)
women_research <- women_research %>% group_by(country) %>% mutate(Avg.Women.Percent = mean(percent_women)) %>% ungroup()
women_research$PercentWomen <- as.character(round(women_research$percent_women, 3))
p1 <- ggplot(women_research) +
 aes(x = reorder(country,Avg.Women.Percent), fill = country, weight = percent_women, tooltip = PercentWomen, data_id = country) +
 geom_bar_interactive() +
 scale_fill_viridis_d(option = "magma") +
 coord_flip() +
 theme_minimal() +
  labs(y = "Percent of Publications/Patents", x = "Country/Grouping [sorted by avg.]", fill="Country/Grouping", title = "Publication and Invention by Women Around the World", subtitle = "Percent of Publications or Patents by Women", caption = "source: Economist Visualization Errors") +
 facet_wrap(~field)
girafe(code = print(p1))
```
