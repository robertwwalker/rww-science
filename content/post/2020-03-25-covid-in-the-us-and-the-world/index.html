<h2>US Death Rate</h2>
<p>Given the data, what does the US Case Fatality Rate look like at this point? Two caveats for this. The first, uncertainty in the numerator. The number of deaths is surely undercounted, probably dramatically based on anecdotes from non-medical first responders. Second, we know the numerator is also undercounted. Assuming asymptomatic cases, the rules prohibited testing them for a substantial period of time on top of the existing scarcity of tests.</p>
