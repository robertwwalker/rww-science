<div id="xbrl-changed" class="section level1">
<h1>XBRL Changed</h1>
<p>XBRL has undergone and is undergoing some changes. Some filers have already needed to change their filings and others will have to soon. Here is the excerpt.</p>
<div class="figure">

<p>This has broken many of the existing parsers for new filings. It is time to find a way around this. I have seen links for scraping them from <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/web-scraping-for-accounting-analysis-using-python-part-1-b5fc016a1c9a">Yahoo! Finance</a> but that is not really what I want.</p>
