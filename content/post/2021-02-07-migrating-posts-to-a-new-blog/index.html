<p>My new blog will be <a href="https://rww-science.website">rww-science.website</a>.</p>
<p>I am going to host the blogdown part under a new url. All of the content in one static site was never something that I complete thought through and making it a bit more modular makes sense on a whole bunch of levels. Besides, new versions of Hugo have made it far easier to do a variety of things than it was when this started in 2018 and I would like to take advantage of a lot of new features in an updated blog.</p>
