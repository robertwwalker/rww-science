# Updating Hugo: It's Changed Alot...

Many key features of hugo have been in a state of flux since I began this *blogdown* a few years ago.  It was time to update hugo and the academic theme that I have built around and customized and a number of things broke.  [Page bundles](https://alison.rbind.io/post/2019-02-21-hugo-page-bundles/) are pretty amazing for keeping things in order and all of the elements of a post together in the same directory.  So far, I think it is a definite across the board improvement.  But some things seem to simply not work.

## Describing the migration

R was key to doing this.  Turning every .Rmd file to a page bundle would have been quite hard if I had not had the ability to use R's internal abilities to create directories and copy and move files to pull the original file name from the .Rmd, create a directory from that, and then copy that file to the needed directory and give it the name index.Rmd.  Awesome!

## The config.toml and the like

In my original website, there was only one configuation file.  Now it has split into four parts; for blogdown, config.toml stays in root but three new files are created, languages, params, and menus.  I do not know of a way to handle this automatically or automagically.

## The Posts

One innovation over the range of versions between my original build and the present is the use of containerized posts.  You can now put everything relevant to a particular post in post's own directory.  The previous need for separate data folders and the extensive use of `here()` was something of a pain.  This is much improved.  But the transition was less than simple.

My favorite tools for doing this became the system capabilities of R.  Here is how it worked.

```
library(tidyverse)
setwd("content/post/") # Get to the root of posts
Posts <- as.vector(as.character(dir())) # Create a vector listing files
Post.List <- Posts %>% data.frame(Post=.) %>% filter(Post != "_index.md") %>% transmute(Post = as.character(Post))
Dir.List <- Post.List %>% filter(str_ends(Post, ".Rmd")) %>% mutate(Dirs=str_remove(Post, ".Rmd"))
Paste.List <- Dir.List %>% mutate(fileTO = paste0(Dirs,'/index.Rmd'))
sapply(1:dim(Dir.List)[[1]], function(x) { dir.create(Dir.List$Dirs[x])} )
file.copy(Paste.List$Post,Paste.List$fileTO)
```


Then it becomes a matter of cleaning up the remaining .Rmd files.  In *blogdown*, the next step is:

```
file.remove(Paste.List$Post)
```

You can then use the clean function in Build to get rid of the rest automagically.  I should point out that the same trick works for containerizing other content.

## The Logo and Icons

This was the last issue and it took a bit of time to find in the docs.  They are extensive but I never mastered finding things in them.  You have to create `assets/images` and then include the `logo.png` and the `icon.png` in that directory.  Then the websites icon on the browser bar and the logo on the navigation bar are, or should be sorted out.
