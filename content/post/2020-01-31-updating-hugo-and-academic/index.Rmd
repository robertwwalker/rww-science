# Updating Hugo: It's Changed Alot...

Many key features of hugo have been in a state of flux since I began this *blogdown* a few years ago.  It was time to update hugo and the academic theme that I have built around and customized and a number of things broke.  [Page bundles](https://alison.rbind.io/post/2019-02-21-hugo-page-bundles/) are pretty amazing for keeping things in order and all of the elements of a post together in the same directory.  So far, I think it is a definite across the board improvement.  But some things seem to simply not work.

## Describing the migration

R was key to doing this.  Turning every .Rmd file to a page bundle would have been quite hard if I had not had the ability to use R's internal abilities to create directories and copy and move files to pull the original file name from the .Rmd, create a directory from that, and then copy that file to the needed directory and give it the name index.Rmd.  Awesome!

## The config.toml and the like

In my original website, there was only one configuation file.  Now it has split into four parts; for blogdown, config.toml stays in root but three new files are created, languages, params, and menus.

## The Logo and Icons

This was the last issue and it took a bit of time to find in the docs.  They are extensive but I never mastered finding things in them.  You have to create `assets/images` and then include the `logo.png` and the `icon.png` in that directory.  Then the websites icon on the browser bar and the logo on the navigation bar are, or should be sorted out.
