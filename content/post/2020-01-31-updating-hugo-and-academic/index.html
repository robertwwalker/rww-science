<h1>Updating Hugo: It’s Changed Alot…</h1>
<p>Many key features of hugo have been in a state of flux since I began this <em>blogdown</em> a few years ago. It was time to update hugo and the academic theme that I have built around and customized and a number of things broke. <a href="https://alison.rbind.io/post/2019-02-21-hugo-page-bundles/">Page bundles</a> are pretty amazing for keeping things in order and all of the elements of a post together in the same directory. So far, I think it is a definite across the board improvement. But some things seem to simply not work.</p>
<div id="describing-the-migration" class="section level2">
<h2>Describing the migration</h2>
<p>R was key to doing this. Turning every .Rmd file to a page bundle would have been quite hard if I had not had the ability to use R’s internal abilities to create directories and copy and move files to pull the original file name from the .Rmd, create a directory from that, and then copy that file to the needed directory and give it the name index.Rmd. Awesome!</p>
</div>
<div id="the-config.toml-and-the-like" class="section level2">
<h2>The config.toml and the like</h2>
<p>In my original website, there was only one configuation file. Now it has split into four parts; for blogdown, config.toml stays in root but three new files are created, languages, params, and menus. I do not know of a way to handle this automatically or automagically.</p>
</div>
<div id="the-posts" class="section level2">
<h2>The Posts</h2>
<p>One innovation over the range of versions between my original build and the present is the use of containerized posts. You can now put everything relevant to a particular post in post’s own directory. The previous need for separate data folders and the extensive use of <code>here()</code> was something of a pain. This is much improved. But the transition was less than simple.</p>
<p>My favorite tools for doing this became the system capabilities of R. Here is how it worked.</p>
<pre><code>library(tidyverse)
setwd(&quot;content/post/&quot;) # Get to the root of posts
Posts &lt;- as.vector(as.character(dir())) # Create a vector listing files
Post.List &lt;- Posts %&gt;% data.frame(Post=.) %&gt;% filter(Post != &quot;_index.md&quot;) %&gt;% transmute(Post = as.character(Post))
Dir.List &lt;- Post.List %&gt;% filter(str_ends(Post, &quot;.Rmd&quot;)) %&gt;% mutate(Dirs=str_remove(Post, &quot;.Rmd&quot;))
Paste.List &lt;- Dir.List %&gt;% mutate(fileTO = paste0(Dirs,&#39;/index.Rmd&#39;))
sapply(1:dim(Dir.List)[[1]], function(x) { dir.create(Dir.List$Dirs[x])} )
file.copy(Paste.List$Post,Paste.List$fileTO)</code></pre>
<p>Then it becomes a matter of cleaning up the remaining .Rmd files. In <em>blogdown</em>, the next step is:</p>
<pre><code>file.remove(Paste.List$Post)</code></pre>
<p>You can then use the clean function in Build to get rid of the rest automagically. I should point out that the same trick works for containerizing other content.</p>
</div>
<div id="the-logo-and-icons" class="section level2">
<h2>The Logo and Icons</h2>
<p>This was the last issue and it took a bit of time to find in the docs. They are extensive but I never mastered finding things in them. You have to create <code>assets/images</code> and then include the <code>logo.png</code> and the <code>icon.png</code> in that directory. Then the websites icon on the browser bar and the logo on the navigation bar are, or should be sorted out.</p>
