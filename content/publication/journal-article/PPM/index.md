abstract: To measure the effect of veterans’ preference on U.S. federal workforce
  quality, researchers have assessed whether military veterans advance in their federal
  careers at a different rate than nonveterans. This research, however, has produced
  mixed results. In research concerning recent employee cohorts, nonveterans outpace
  veterans’ advancement, implying that veterans’ preference lessens employee quality.
  In older cohorts, veterans and nonveterans advance comparably. The latter research,
  however, controls for employees’ entry positions, whereas research concerning recent
  cohorts does not do so, thus inhibiting direct comparison of results. To facilitate
  such comparisons, we controlled for veterans’ and nonveterans’ entry positions in
  a study of career advancement among all white-collar, U.S. executive branch workers
  entering employment from 1992 to 2013. In these recent cohorts, we find roughly
  equivalent rates of career advancement among veterans and nonveterans when controlling
  for entry positions. This finding holds when using grade or pay increases as measures
  of advancement.
