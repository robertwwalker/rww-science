abstract: Research suggests that outsourcing is one way that local governments have
  to meet rising expectations and unwillingness to pay when resources are constrained.
  The degree to which resources are constrained is a function not only of local economic
  and political conditions, but of state rules as well. We build on previous models
  of local government outsourcing by studying the interaction between state rules
  and local fiscal, economic, and political conditions. We find that cities in states
  that place limits on the resources available to local governments choose differently
  from among the constellation of service provision options than cities in states
  without such limits.
