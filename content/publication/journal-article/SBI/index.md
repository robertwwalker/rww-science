abstract: We present a simple method for estimating regressions based on recursive
  extensive-form games. Our procedure, which can be implemented in most standard statistical
  packages, involves sequentially estimating standard logits (or probits) in a manner
  analogous to backwards induction. We demonstrate that the technique produces consistent
  parameter estimates and show how to calculate consistent standard errors. To illustrate
  the method, we replicate Leblang’s (2003) study of speculative attacks by financial
  markets and government responses to these attacks.
