abstract: The battles playing out in local governments across America over development
  and growth management have important long-term implications that are often difficult
  to measure because of the long lag between policy decisions and the consequences
  of those decisions. This study suggests one way of investigating the long-term effects
  of policy decisions in the area of growth management. The consequences of development
  and growth management policies should be of great interest to those who invest in
  the debt issued by a community because it is the value of property that provides
  the underlying guarantee of that debt. One might assume that aggressive development
  is good for investors because a larger tax base increases the size of the underlying
  asset guaranteeing the debt, but borrowing from the dominant model in the investment
  literature on asset pricing, this article suggests that investors are significantly
  concerned with the future variability in the value of an investment. Future change,
  therefore—or at least the possibility of change—represents a risk for investors,
  a risk that is manifested in lower bond ratings and ultimately in higher interest
  costs on a jurisdiction’s debt. Support for this notion is illustrated in a test
  on a sample of cities in Massachusetts.
