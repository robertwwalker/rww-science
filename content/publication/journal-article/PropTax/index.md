abstract: In this article, the authors describe the evolution of Oregon’s one-off
  property tax system, which emphasizes stable growth in tax assessments and payments
  and interjurisdictional uniformity in tax rates.They also compare two sections of
  Portland — the affluent neighborhoods on the west side of the Willamette River and
  the poorer ones on the east side — to determine how assessment quality and interjurisdictional
  tax burdens deteriorate without periodic reassessment.
