abstract: We examine models that relax proportionality in cumulative ordered regression  models.
  Something fundamental arising from ordered variables and stochastic ordering implies
  a partitioning. Efforts to relax proportionality also relax the ability to collapse
  an inherently multidimensional problem to a partitioning of the (unidimensional)
  real line. It is surprising and  unfortunate  to  find  that  deviations  from  proportionality  are  sufficient  to  generate
  internal contradictions; undecidable propositions must exist by relaxing proportional
  odds without other relevant and significant changes in the underlying model. We
  prove a single theorem linking continuous support and partitions of a latent space
  to show that for these two characteristics to be simultaneously satisfied, the model
  must be the proportional-odds model. Conditioning on the adjacency that is closely
  related to the partitioning is fruitful, but at this point we join the class of
  continuation-ratio models. Alternatively, Andersonâ€™s (1984) stereotype model is
  quite general and nests ordered and unordered choice models, but  again  we  have  left  the  domain  of  cumulative  models.  Adopting  multidimensional
  cumulative models or imposing covariate-specific thresholds are the only certain
  methods for avoiding these troubles  in the  cumulative  framework.  It  is  generically  impossible  to
  generalize the cumulative class of ordered regression models in ways consistent
  with the spirit of generalized cumulative regression models. Monte Carlo studies
  also demonstrate the general principles.
abstract_short: Generalizations of cumulative ordered regression models do not exist
  because the very definition of *generalizing* contradicts the sum to one definition
  of probabilities implicit in the models.  In an analytical proof and in a Monte
  Carlo simulation, I show outcomes to be undefined and/or multiply defined with even
  the slightest generalizations.  Fortunately, the class of continuation ratio and
  stopping ratio models address these precise claims that motivated generalizations
  and are readily available and sensible.
