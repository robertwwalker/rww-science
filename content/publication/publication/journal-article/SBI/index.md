abstract: We present a simple method for estimating regressions based on recursive
  extensive-form games. Our procedure, which can be implemented in most standard statistical
  packages, involves sequentially estimating standard logits (or probits) in a manner
  analogous to backwards induction. We demonstrate that the technique produces consistent
  parameter estimates and show how to calculate consistent standard errors. To illustrate
  the method, we replicate Leblangâ€™s (2003) study of speculative attacks by financial
  markets and government responses to these attacks.
