abstract: One of the central claims of public administration is that management matters
  for the performance of public entities. Quantifying the impact of organizational
  management is thus central to the empirical evaluation of this claim. Utilizing
  novel features of the Government Performance Project (GPP), we assess the impact
  of state‐level management practices on the credit quality of US states. The central
  challenge—that both the GPP data and bond ratings take the form of ordinal grades—suggests
  a common solution utilizing multiple indicators of a latent construct (management
  capacity and credit quality) with appropriate measurement models. After describing
  the characteristics of the measurement approach, we derive management capacity scores
  from the GPP data and credit quality scores using bond ratings from the three rating
  agencies. These derived scores then allow us to test linkages between credit quality
  of the US states and broad aspects of their relative management capacity. On the
  whole, we show that financial management capacity influences credit quality, while
  the evidence is less clear that other forms of management capacity matter.
abstract_short: We study the effects of four measures of management quality on credit
  quality in the US states.  Recongizing that bond ratings are a multiple rater problem,
  we first deploy an item-response model to measure latent credit quality.  The same
  structure describes the GPP's measures of Financial, Information, Infrastructure,
  and People Management and we scale these data as well.  In models that include other
  predictors, we show that financial management are the core driver of state credit
  quality.
