abstract: This article evaluates two alternative standards for resetting property
  assessments on title transfer in property tax systems like Oregon's and California's
  that are explicitly designed to protect property owners against rapid, unanticipated
  increases in their tax bills, California's reset to market and one in which the
  property is given a new assessed value based on its market value multiplied by a
  ratio that reflects the average relationship between assessed value and market value
  within a jurisdiction. People find that the latter promotes assessment quality better
  than the former and probably mitigates lock-in.
