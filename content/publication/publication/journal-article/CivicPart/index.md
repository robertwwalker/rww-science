abstract: Differences in levels of political engagement between blacks and whites
  have long captured scholars' interest. As a consequence, this topic has been heavily
  studied in American politics. However, many of these studies have taken a static
  approach to analyzing political behavior and few have examined how individuals orient
  themselves to political participation over time. Yet, engagement in political behavior
  as well as the information that can be obtained from any specific political action
  will change within a mutable political environment. In our examination of patterns
  in blacks' and whites' political engagement between 1973 and 1994, we investigate
  the ability of various civic activities to differentiate between high and low propensity
  participators. This dynamic analysis, with the incorporation of a unique methodological
  approach, reveals a gradual increase in blacks' likelihood to engage in politics.
  Moreover, the increase in blacks' engagement has served to diminish racial disparities
  in political behavior over time.
