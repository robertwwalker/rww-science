abstract: Recent research by Box-Steffensmeier and Smith (Box-Steffensmeier, J.M.,
  Smith, R.M., 1996. The dynamics of aggregate partisanship. American Political Science
  Review 90, 567–580; Box-Steffensmeier, J.M., Smith, R.M., 1998. Investigating political
  dynamics using fractional integration methods. American Journal of Political Science
  42, 661–689) has alerted scholars to the problems involved in the analysis of fractionally
  integrated time series. This paper pursues this line of inquiry by compiling evidence
  on the time series properties of a number of common variables used in political
  research, including macropartisanship, presidential approval, the monthly and quarterly
  index of consumer sentiment, percentage liberalism in Supreme Court decision making,
  and others. In applying a variety of formal tests to these series, we fail to reject
  hypotheses of random walk or fractionally integrated processes while commonly rejecting
  hypotheses of stationary behavior. Evidence obtained from point estimates of the
  fractional differencing parameter, d, supports these findings while providing a
  glimpse into the long-memory characteristics of many political time series. Finally,
  Monte Carlo studies are performed that demonstrate the likelihood of spurious regressions
  when researchers fail to account for the fractional dynamics of time series.
