abstract: Bond ratings on state-issued debt provide a signal to credit markets that
  help them charge an appropriate interest rate, based on the risk of payment default.
  Though actual default may occur only in extreme circumstances, observed differences
  in ratings and interest costs across states and time demonstrate that a sound economy,
  strong financials, and stable policies matter. When data on the factors that presumably
  affect ratings is public and easily accessible, making sense of differences of opinion
  between bond rating agencies is difficult. We suggest that such differences—observed
  as so-called split bond ratings—are often ephemeral. Utilizing a simulation method
  to uncover the latent credit risk presented by each state, we show that split ratings
  on state bonds are often due to the fact that presumed category overlap between
  rating agencies is absent when evaluated on a common latent scale. Most observed
  state bond rating splits from 1997 through 2006 can be explained by this category
  mismatch. Our approach has broad implications for pricing state debt, as well as
  pricing rated debt in other capital market sectors.
