abstract: The management of the fuzzy front end (FFE) phase of innovation is crucial
  to the ultimate success of new product and process initiatives. A critical challenge
  that teams face at this stage is dealing with equivocality â€“ the extent to which
  project participants grapple with multiple, and plausibly conflicting, meanings
  and interpretations of the information available to them (Daft and Lengel, 1986;
  Weick, 1979). While initially, a certain level of equivocality is beneficial for
  enhancing team creativity and preventing early closure, at some point it must be
  resolved in order for an idea to become a viable New Product Development (NPD) project.
  This study employs a social networks perspective to understand how different types
  of informal work-based relations and their structural properties affect equivocality
  on project teams in the FFE. In particular, it examines the structural effects of
  two types of social relations and their associated networks -- technical-advice
  and friendship ties. The findings suggest that while high density in a projects
  technical-advice network is likely to reduce equivocality, high density in a projects
  friendship network is likely to increase it. More interestingly, having multiple
  members on projects who are highly central in the lab technical-advice network tends
  to increase equivocality unless it is balanced with members who occupy positions
  of high centrality in the lab friendship network. In addition to contributing to
  the scholarship on NPD, FFE, and social networks, the results offer managerial insights
  for deploying social networks in order to assemble NPD teams and structure the flows
  of communication on projects so as to resolve equivocality in the FFE.
