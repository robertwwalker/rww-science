&lt;div id=&#34;the-office&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Office&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;library(tidyverse)
office_ratings &amp;lt;- readr::read_csv(&amp;#39;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2020/2020-03-17/office_ratings.csv&amp;#39;)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;a-first-plot&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A First Plot&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The number of episodes for the Office by season.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;library(janitor)
TableS &amp;lt;- office_ratings %&amp;gt;% tabyl(season)
p1 &amp;lt;- TableS %&amp;gt;% ggplot(., aes(x=as.factor(season), y=n, fill=as.factor(season))) + geom_col() + labs(x=&amp;quot;Season&amp;quot;, y=&amp;quot;Episodes&amp;quot;, title=&amp;quot;The Office: Episodes&amp;quot;) + guides(fill=FALSE)
p1&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/post/2020-03-19-tidytuesday-on-the-office/index_files/figure-html/pressure-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;ratings&#34; class=&#34;section level1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Ratings&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How are the various seasons and episodes rated?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;p2 &amp;lt;- office_ratings %&amp;gt;% ggplot(., aes(x=as.factor(season), y=imdb_rating, fill=as.factor(season), color=as.factor(season))) + geom_violin(alpha=0.3) + guides(fill=FALSE, color=FALSE) + labs(x=&amp;quot;Season&amp;quot;, y=&amp;quot;IMDB Rating&amp;quot;) + geom_point()
p2&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/post/2020-03-19-tidytuesday-on-the-office/index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;patchwork&#34; class=&#34;section level1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Patchwork&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using &lt;code&gt;patchwork&lt;/code&gt;, we can combine multiple plots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;library(patchwork)
(p1) / p2&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/post/2020-03-19-tidytuesday-on-the-office/index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;ratings-part-ii&#34; class=&#34;section level1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Ratings Part II&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s show the episode names. The tooltip doesn’t interact well with the violin plot. It needs points by themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;library(widgetframe)
p3 &amp;lt;- office_ratings %&amp;gt;% ggplot(., aes(x=as.factor(season), y=imdb_rating, fill=as.factor(season), color=as.factor(season), text=title)) + geom_point()  + guides(fill=FALSE, color=FALSE) + labs(x=&amp;quot;Season&amp;quot;, y=&amp;quot;IMDB Rating&amp;quot;) 
# The violin was trashing the tooltip.  I have to get rid of it.
library(plotly)
# ggplotly(p3, tooltip = &amp;quot;text&amp;quot;)
p3&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/post/2020-03-19-tidytuesday-on-the-office/index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;something-i-like&#34; class=&#34;section level1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Something I Like&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A better and more customized version of the violin plot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;library(hrbrthemes); library(ggthemes)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## NOTE: Either Arial Narrow or Roboto Condensed fonts are required to use these themes.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;##       Please use hrbrthemes::import_roboto_condensed() to install Roboto Condensed and&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;##       if Arial Narrow is not on your system, please see http://bit.ly/arialnarrow&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;ggplot(office_ratings, aes(x=as.factor(season), y=imdb_rating, fill=as.factor(season), color=as.factor(season))) + geom_violin(alpha=0.3) + guides(fill=FALSE, color=FALSE) + labs(x=&amp;quot;Season&amp;quot;, y=&amp;quot;IMDB Rating&amp;quot;, title=&amp;quot;IMDB Ratings: The Office by Season&amp;quot;, caption=&amp;quot;a #tidyTuesday&amp;quot;) + theme_economist_white() + scale_fill_ipsum() + scale_color_ipsum() + geom_jitter()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/post/2020-03-19-tidytuesday-on-the-office/index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;a-plotly&#34; class=&#34;section level1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;A Plotly&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;ggplotly&lt;/code&gt; does not love multiple geoms. In this case, the lines are ignored but the tool tip works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;p4 &amp;lt;- ggplot(office_ratings, aes(x=air_date, y=imdb_rating, color=as.factor(season), text=title)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth() +  guides(color=FALSE) + labs(x=&amp;quot;Date Aired&amp;quot;, y=&amp;quot;IMDB Rating&amp;quot;)
# The tooltip kills the smooth.
p5 &amp;lt;- ggplotly(p4)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## `geom_smooth()` using method = &amp;#39;loess&amp;#39; and formula &amp;#39;y ~ x&amp;#39;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;frameWidget(p5)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;htmlwidget-1&#34; style=&#34;width:100%;height:480px;&#34; class=&#34;widgetframe html-widget&#34;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;&lt;code&gt;tidyTuesday&lt;/code&gt; on the Carbon Footprint of Feeding the Planet&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tidyTuesday for this week relies on data scraped from the Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations. The blog post for obtaining the data can be found on &lt;a href=&#34;https://r-tastic.co.uk/post/from-messy-to-tidy/&#34;&gt;r-tastic&lt;/a&gt;. The scraping exercise is nice and easy to follow and explored a case of cleaning up a very messy data structure. I took this exercise as practice for using &lt;code&gt;pivot_wider&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;pivot_longer&lt;/code&gt;. The data are by country so a map seems appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;library(tidyverse)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## ── Attaching packages ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse 1.3.0 ──&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;food_consumption &amp;lt;- readr::read_csv(&amp;#39;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2020/2020-02-18/food_consumption.csv&amp;#39;)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## Parsed with column specification:
## cols(
##   country = col_character(),
##   food_category = col_character(),
##   consumption = col_double(),
##   co2_emmission = col_double()
## )&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;names(food_consumption)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## [1] &amp;quot;country&amp;quot;       &amp;quot;food_category&amp;quot; &amp;quot;consumption&amp;quot;   &amp;quot;co2_emmission&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can see, the variables are already tidy. What categories of food are available?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;table(food_consumption$food_category)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;##

&lt;p&gt;NB: There are five names of countries that do not reconcile with the world map that I will use. The &lt;code&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;code&gt;UK&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;code&gt;Taiwan. ROC&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;code&gt;Taiwan&lt;/code&gt;. Trinidad and Tobago are separate on the map but together in the data. Hong Kong is not differentiated from China on the map. &lt;code&gt;Congo&lt;/code&gt; is ambiguous because it could refer to the DRC or Rep. of Congo. I will ignore the error on Hong Kong and skip Congo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;food_consumption$country[food_consumption$country==&amp;quot;United Kingdom&amp;quot;] &amp;lt;- &amp;quot;UK&amp;quot;
TNT &amp;lt;- food_consumption %&amp;gt;% filter(country==&amp;quot;Trinidad and Tobago&amp;quot;)
food_consumption$country[food_consumption$country==&amp;quot;Trinidad and Tobago&amp;quot;] &amp;lt;- &amp;quot;Trinidad&amp;quot;
food_consumption &amp;lt;- rbind(food_consumption,TNT)
food_consumption$country[food_consumption$country==&amp;quot;Trinidad and Tobago&amp;quot;] &amp;lt;- &amp;quot;Tobago&amp;quot;
food_consumption$country[food_consumption$country==&amp;quot;Taiwan. ROC&amp;quot;] &amp;lt;- &amp;quot;Taiwan&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to map the totals which were removed from the posted data set. Let me recreate those. I will first do the co2 column. I need to drop consumption, pivot them to wide, and sum up the numeric variables. Then I want to pivot it back to long with the total as a food category.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;FCCO2W &amp;lt;- food_consumption %&amp;gt;% 
  select(-consumption) %&amp;gt;% 
  pivot_wider(.,names_from = food_category, values_from = co2_emmission, names_prefix = &amp;quot;CO2_&amp;quot;)  %&amp;gt;% 
  mutate(CO2_Total = rowSums(select(., contains(&amp;quot;CO2_&amp;quot;)))) 
FCCO2L &amp;lt;- FCCO2W %&amp;gt;% 
  pivot_longer(., cols = names(FCCO2W)[2:13], values_to = &amp;quot;CO2&amp;quot;) %&amp;gt;% 
  mutate(food_category = str_remove(name, &amp;quot;CO2_&amp;quot;)) %&amp;gt;% 
  select(-name)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now there are long and wide versions of CO2. Same process for food production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;FCConsumeW &amp;lt;- food_consumption %&amp;gt;% 
  select(-co2_emmission) %&amp;gt;% 
  pivot_wider(.,names_from = food_category, values_from = consumption, names_prefix = &amp;quot;Consumption_&amp;quot;) %&amp;gt;% 
  mutate(Consumption_Total = rowSums(select(., contains(&amp;quot;Consumption_&amp;quot;)))) 
FCConsumeL &amp;lt;- FCConsumeW %&amp;gt;% 
  pivot_longer(., cols = names(FCConsumeW)[2:13], values_to = &amp;quot;Consumption&amp;quot;) %&amp;gt;% 
  mutate(food_category = str_remove(name, &amp;quot;Consumption_&amp;quot;)) %&amp;gt;% 
  select(-name)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, let me merge them back together. One version of Rejoinder is long [L] and the other is wide [W].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;RejoinderL &amp;lt;- left_join(FCCO2L,FCConsumeL, by = c(&amp;quot;country&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;food_category&amp;quot;))
RejoinderW &amp;lt;- left_join(FCCO2W,FCConsumeW, by = &amp;quot;country&amp;quot;)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With that manipulation and cleaning complete, it is time to map it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;require(maps)
require(viridis)
theme_set(
  theme_void()
)
# A Base Map
world_map &amp;lt;- map_data(&amp;quot;world&amp;quot;)
world_map &amp;lt;- world_map %&amp;gt;% mutate(country = region) 
WM &amp;lt;- ggplot(world_map, aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group)) +
  geom_polygon(fill=&amp;quot;lightgray&amp;quot;, colour = &amp;quot;white&amp;quot;)
WM&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/post/2020-02-18-the-carbon-footprint-of-food-produced-for-consumption/index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s a map to work with. Now let me join the data and plot the CO2 production. There is a check before to make sure that all the matches are mapped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;anti_join(RejoinderW, world_map)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## Joining, by = &amp;quot;country&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## # A tibble: 2 x 25
##   country CO2_Pork CO2_Poultry CO2_Beef `CO2_Lamb &amp;amp; Goa… CO2_Fish CO2_Eggs
##   &amp;lt;chr&amp;gt;      &amp;lt;dbl&amp;gt;       &amp;lt;dbl&amp;gt;    &amp;lt;dbl&amp;gt;            &amp;lt;dbl&amp;gt;    &amp;lt;dbl&amp;gt;    &amp;lt;dbl&amp;gt;
## 1 Hong K…   238.          58.9     797.             77.7     67.8    13.3 
## 2 Congo       8.46        14.0     134.             14.0     41.9     0.55
## # … with 18 more variables: `CO2_Milk - inc. cheese` &amp;lt;dbl&amp;gt;, `CO2_Wheat and
## #   Wheat Products` &amp;lt;dbl&amp;gt;, CO2_Rice &amp;lt;dbl&amp;gt;, CO2_Soybeans &amp;lt;dbl&amp;gt;, `CO2_Nuts inc.
## #   Peanut Butter` &amp;lt;dbl&amp;gt;, CO2_Total &amp;lt;dbl&amp;gt;, Consumption_Pork &amp;lt;dbl&amp;gt;,
## #   Consumption_Poultry &amp;lt;dbl&amp;gt;, Consumption_Beef &amp;lt;dbl&amp;gt;, `Consumption_Lamb &amp;amp;
## #   Goat` &amp;lt;dbl&amp;gt;, Consumption_Fish &amp;lt;dbl&amp;gt;, Consumption_Eggs &amp;lt;dbl&amp;gt;,

## #   `Consumption_Nuts inc. Peanut Butter` &amp;lt;dbl&amp;gt;, Consumption_Total &amp;lt;dbl&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I fixed the original entries that exist above; some failures can’t be fixed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;FCWM &amp;lt;- world_map %&amp;gt;% left_join(., RejoinderW)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## Joining, by = &amp;quot;country&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;WMCO2 &amp;lt;- ggplot(FCWM, aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group, fill=CO2_Total)) +
  geom_polygon(colour = &amp;quot;white&amp;quot;) + 
  scale_fill_viridis_c(option = &amp;quot;C&amp;quot;) +
  labs(fill = &amp;quot;Total CO2&amp;quot;, title=&amp;quot;Total CO2 from Food Produced for Consumption [kg/person/year]&amp;quot;, caption=&amp;quot;a #tidyTuesday by @PieRatio&amp;quot;)
WMCO2&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/post/2020-02-18-the-carbon-footprint-of-food-produced-for-consumption/index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now let me plot the food produced for consumption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;WMFood &amp;lt;- ggplot(FCWM, aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group, fill=Consumption_Total)) +
  geom_polygon(colour = &amp;quot;white&amp;quot;) + 
  scale_fill_viridis_c(option = &amp;quot;C&amp;quot;) +
  labs(fill = &amp;quot;Total&amp;quot;, title=&amp;quot;Total Food Produced for Consumption [kg/person/year]&amp;quot;, caption=&amp;quot;a #tidyTuesday by @PieRatio&amp;quot;)
WMFood&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/post/2020-02-18-the-carbon-footprint-of-food-produced-for-consumption/index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-10-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wanted to combine them but that did not work with patchwork.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;WMCO2 + WMFood
# Doesn&amp;#39;t work.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now let me do them with facets. That will require taking the merged wide data and pivoting it to longer. First, I will select the columns that are critical to the map and the two series that I need. I also want to change the names up a bit to make the facets well labeled. After that, pivot to longer so that I can map the two categories separately. One thing that went wrong along the way is the guide. The facets are given a common guide while food in kg has a vastly different scale than CO2. The easiest way to show them is to use a z-score for each and to show how the various countries compare to the average [keep in mind they are already normalized by population].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Map.Me &amp;lt;- FCWM %&amp;gt;% select(long, lat, group, order, region, CO2_Total, Consumption_Total) %&amp;gt;% mutate(CO2_Total = scale(CO2_Total), `Food Supplied_Total` = scale(Consumption_Total)) %&amp;gt;% select(-Consumption_Total)
Map.Me &amp;lt;- pivot_longer(Map.Me, cols = c(CO2_Total, `Food Supplied_Total`)) %&amp;gt;% mutate(name = str_remove(name, &amp;quot;_Total&amp;quot;))
Facet.Map &amp;lt;- ggplot(Map.Me, aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group, fill=value)) +
  geom_polygon(colour = &amp;quot;white&amp;quot;) + 
  scale_fill_viridis_c(option = &amp;quot;C&amp;quot;) +
  labs(fill = &amp;quot;kg/person/year&amp;quot;, caption=&amp;quot;a #tidyTuesday by @PieRatio&amp;quot;, title=&amp;quot;Food Produced for Consumption and the CO2 Impact&amp;quot;, subtitle = &amp;quot;Z-scored for comparability; greys are missing.&amp;quot;) +
  facet_wrap(vars(name))
Facet.Map&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/post/2020-02-18-the-carbon-footprint-of-food-produced-for-consumption/index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-12-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cool. It works. Now I want to go back to the original data and the blog post. That is fundamentally concerned with a differential.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;figure&#34;&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;data/tidyTuesdayFood.png&#34; alt=&#34;ScreenShot&#34; /&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;caption&#34;&gt;ScreenShot&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;animal-vs.non-animal-co2&#34; class=&#34;section level1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Animal vs. Non-Animal CO2&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These data will require some recreation; that’s the reason for keeping and creating the wide data above. The pivots. I don’t really care so much about the actual food production here; this is about the carbon footprint. There is a color coding key to the above spreadsheet and I just need to pull it out. The oranges are animal and the greens are not. Just pick out the right columns to sum up and we are ready to go. Above, that is the FCC02W data.frame. As an aside, this is yet another criticism of spreadsheets; you can encode data in the colors that isn’t recoverable in any interesting way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, the reason they are missing is that that part of the scraping is a bit kludgy; the original author was seeking comment on it. Perhaps you can skip columns that are sums of those that precede it. The tidyTuesday has the cleaning script. I just have to remove the filter.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>


&lt;p&gt;First, I wanted to acquire the distribution of letters and then play with that. I embedded the result here. The second step is to import the tidyTuesday data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;library(tidyverse)
Letter.Freq &amp;lt;- data.frame(stringsAsFactors=FALSE,
                     Letter = c(&amp;quot;E&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;T&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;A&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;O&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;I&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;N&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;S&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;R&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;H&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;D&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;L&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;U&amp;quot;,
                                &amp;quot;C&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;M&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;F&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Y&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;W&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;G&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;P&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;B&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;V&amp;quot;,
                                &amp;quot;K&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;X&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Q&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;J&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Z&amp;quot;),
                  Frequency = c(12.02, 9.1, 8.12, 7.68, 7.31, 6.95, 6.28, 6.02, 5.92, 4.32,
                                3.98, 2.88, 2.71, 2.61, 2.3, 2.11, 2.09, 2.03,
                                1.82, 1.49, 1.11, 0.69, 0.17, 0.11, 0.1, 0.07)
               )
Letter.Freq &amp;lt;- Letter.Freq %&amp;gt;% mutate(Frequency = Frequency / 100, Letter = tolower(Letter))
passwords &amp;lt;- readr::read_csv(&amp;#39;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2020/2020-01-14/passwords.csv&amp;#39;)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me visualize the distribution of letters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;library(ggthemes)
ggplot(Letter.Freq) + aes(x=reorder(Letter, desc(Letter)), y=Frequency) + geom_col() + coord_flip() + theme_economist() + labs(x=&amp;quot;&amp;quot;)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/post/2020-01-18-a-quick-tidytuesday-on-passwords/index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to use the &lt;code&gt;tm&lt;/code&gt; library for topic models to extract out the numbers and only work with letters. There is something probably worthwhile to do with Zipf’s law or the like on that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;library(tm)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## Loading required package: NLP&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## 
## Attaching package: &amp;#39;NLP&amp;#39;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## The following object is masked from &amp;#39;package:ggplot2&amp;#39;:
## 
##     annotate&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;# Remove numbers
passwords &amp;lt;- passwords %&amp;gt;% mutate(PasswordNN = removeNumbers(password))
# Split each string into the letters; here I am repurposing a word count function
freq &amp;lt;- function(x,y) {
     word &amp;lt;- tolower(unlist(strsplit(x,&amp;quot;&amp;quot;)))
     word_table &amp;lt;- table(word)
     ans &amp;lt;- word_table[names(word_table)==y]
     return(ans)
}
# Use sapply to apply the function.  This is not tidy but I have never sat down with map
Letter.FreqPW &amp;lt;- sapply(letters,function(x) { freq(passwords$PasswordNN, x) } )
# Rename the resulting vector with proper labels
names(Letter.FreqPW) &amp;lt;- letters
# Clean up the names and metrics
LFPW &amp;lt;- data.frame(Letter.FreqPW)
LFPW$Letter &amp;lt;- row.names(LFPW)
LFPW &amp;lt;- LFPW %&amp;gt;% mutate(Freq = Letter.FreqPW)
# Join a result
Res &amp;lt;- left_join(Letter.Freq, LFPW)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## Joining, by = &amp;quot;Letter&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Res&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s a start. Now for the scatterpie. After a bit of work, I needed to translate the coordinates from most common maps. So I started with a ggmap for easier to work with coordinates.&lt;/p&gt;

statesC &amp;lt;- cbind(states, st_coordinates(st_centroid(states)))
dog_moves &amp;lt;-dog_moves %&amp;gt;% mutate(ID = tolower(location))
statesC &amp;lt;- left_join(statesC, dog_moves)
statesC %&amp;gt;% filter(!is.na(imported) &amp;amp; !is.na(exported) &amp;amp; !is.na(total)) %&amp;gt;% select(X, Y, exported, imported, total) %&amp;gt;% data.frame() -&amp;gt; ShortCD
My.SM &amp;lt;- get_map(c(-124.6813, 25.12993, -67.00742, 49.00508), source=&amp;quot;osm&amp;quot;)
ggmap(My.SM) + geom_scatterpie(data=ShortCD, aes(x=X, y=Y, r=total/3000), cols=c(&amp;quot;exported&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;imported&amp;quot;)) + labs(fill=&amp;quot;Dog Movements&amp;quot;) + theme_map()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

  lapply(htmltools::HTML)

Plot.Zips &amp;lt;- Plot.Zips %&amp;gt;% filter(!is.na(Latitude))
# Final Map
map.l &amp;lt;- leaflet(Plot.Zips) %&amp;gt;% 
  addTiles() %&amp;gt;%
